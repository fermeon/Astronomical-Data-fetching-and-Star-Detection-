# Astronomical-Data-fetching-and-Star-Detectio

This project focuses on visualizing astronomical data from FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files using Python. It combines image processing techniques with World Coordinate System (WCS) information to create informative and visually appealing representations of celestial objects.
Libraries used:

Matplotlib: For creating the plot and handling color mapping.
Astropy: For working with FITS files and WCS data.
NumPy: For numerical operations on image data.

Data source:
The FITS files used in this project are obtained from sky.esa.int, which is the European Space Agency's sky mapping resource. This platform provides a wealth of astronomical data from various missions and surveys.
Prerequisites:
Before undertaking this project, it's recommended to have knowledge in the following areas:

Basic Python programming
Fundamentals of astronomy and celestial coordinates
Understanding of FITS file format and its structure
Familiarity with World Coordinate System (WCS) concepts
Basic image processing techniques
Data visualization principles
Working with scientific Python libraries (Matplotlib, Astropy, NumPy)

The project involves loading FITS files, extracting image data and WCS information, and then using Matplotlib with WCS-aware axes to create a visualization. It also incorporates color mapping and normalization techniques to enhance the visual representation of the astronomical data.
This project serves as an excellent opportunity to combine programming skills with astronomical knowledge, resulting in the creation of informative and visually striking representations of celestial objects and regions.
